```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-website.git
cd portfolio-website
```

2. **Add your content**:
   - Replace `images/profile-photo.jpg` with your profile picture
   - Add project images to the `images/` folder

     # Using Python
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Using Node.js (if you have live-server installed)
     npx live-server
     
     # Using PHP
     php -S localhost:8000
     ```

## üé® Customization

### Colors & Theme
The website uses CSS custom properties for easy theming. Main colors can be changed in `css/style.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2563eb;      /* Main brand color */
    --secondary-color: #f59e0b;    /* Accent color */
    --accent-color: #10b981;       /* Success/highlight color */
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

2. **Skills**: Modify skill percentages in the skills section
3. **Projects**: Update the `projectData` object in `js/script.js`
4. **Social Links**: Update all social media URLs throughout the HTML

### Adding New Sections
The modular CSS makes it easy to add new sections:
1. Add HTML structure following existing patterns
2. Use existing CSS classes for consistency
3. Add scroll animations by including the section in `initializeScrollAnimations()`

## üìß Contact Form

The contact form includes:
